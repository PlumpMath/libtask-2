	* libtask/util/semaphore.h:

	Modified the libtask_semaphore_t interface to not return any error
	code. Also, updated the integer stored in the semaphore to
	int64_t. Since semaphore value is incremented or decremented by
	one, overflowing a 64-bit value is very unlikely (it takes 73
	years to for a 4GHz processor.)

	With the above changes, semaphore operations always succeed. This
	simplifies the error handling because we don't need to take care
	of the failure cases.

	* libtask/util/spinlock.h:

	Added libtask_spinlock_t interface because (1) pthread spinlock
	API can return EDEADLK and it is pretty annoying to handle it
	everytime we take a lock (2) pthread spinlock behavior is
	undefined when unlocking thread is different from the locked
	thread.

	Note: libtask uses spinlocks only for short critical sections, so
	item (2) above is not an issue.
