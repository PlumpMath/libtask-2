	* libtask/util/spinlock.h:

	Added libtask_spinlock_t interface because (1) pthread spinlock
	API can return EDEADLK and it is pretty annoying to handle it
	everytime we take a lock (2) pthread spinlock behavior is
	undefined when unlocking thread is different from the locked
	thread.

	Note: libtask uses spinlocks only for short critical sections, so
	item (2) above is not an issue.
