* TODO

- Task pool should have "schedule" function.

- The "schedule" invocation should wake up threads waiting in the
  "execute" function.

* DONE

- Task pool should have "execute" function.

  It is unnecessary to implement the task-pool execution loop in every
  test case. Having this method as part of the library simplifies the
  testcases. Also, this makes using libtask library less error prone.

- Every task should have a owner task-pool.

  Supporting tasks without an associated task-pool is not a frequent
  case. Besides, creating a task-pool and adding a task to it doesn't
  cost anything, so lets drop support for independent tasks.
